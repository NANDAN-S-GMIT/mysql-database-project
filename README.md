# 📊 MySQL Database Project  

This project was developed as part of the **Meta Database Engineer Specialization (Coursera)**.  
It demonstrates **database design, implementation, and management** using **MySQL** with a focus on real-world applications.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Designed and implemented a **normalized relational database schema**.  
- Applied **MySQL functions, queries, constraints, and joins** for efficient data handling.  
- Created **views, indexes, and stored procedures** to enhance performance.  
- Implemented **data integrity rules** using constraints (PK, FK, Not Null, Unique).  
- Connected SQL queries with **real-world datasets** for practical insights.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `database_schema.sql` → Schema creation script.  
- `insert_data.sql` → Inserts sample records into tables.  
- `queries.sql` → Practice queries and project-based SQL commands.  
- `README.md` → Documentation and learning summary.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **MySQL** (Workbench / CLI)  
- **SQL Functions** → Aggregate, String, Date, Control Flow  
- **Constraints** → Primary Key, Foreign Key, Not Null, Unique  
- **Database Objects** → Views, Indexes, Stored Procedures  

---

## 📜 Learning Outcomes  
- ✅ Designing normalized database schemas.  
- ✅ Writing optimized and reusable SQL queries.  
- ✅ Applying `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and subqueries.  
- ✅ Leveraging views, indexes, and stored procedures in real-world systems.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements  
- Integrate the database with a **backend application** (Spring Boot / Django).  
- Extend into a **full-stack project** with React + MySQL.  
- Deploy database on **cloud platforms** (AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP).
